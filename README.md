## Predicting Legendary Pokémon with Machine Learning

Ever since I was a young boy, I have been obsessed with Pokémon. From the trading cards to the TV shows, and of course, the video games. My first memory of playing video games was sitting up at night playing Pokémon Yellow (underneath the duvet with a torch in case my mum walked in and saw I wasn't sleeping). From my little Game Boy Color to now playing it on my Nintendo Switch, Pokémon has certainly come a long way. However, I still find it as comforting, endearing, exciting, and fun as ever.

So, of course, when I was looking for a data science project, there was really only ever going to be one option.

The purpose of this notebook is to explore some Pokémon data and try to gain some interesting insights, such as the number of Pokémon by type, examining height and weight and exploring how these correlate with type, and analysing how final evolution status affects stats. Additionally, I will try to predict if a Pokémon is legendary or a final evolution using machine learning.

As Ash would say, "I choose you, data science!". It is time to leave Pallet Town and explore...
