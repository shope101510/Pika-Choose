## Predicting Legendary Pokémon with Machine Learning

## Project Overview

Ever since I was a young boy, I have been obsessed with Pokémon. From the trading cards to the TV shows, and of course, the video games. My first memory of playing video games was sitting up at night playing Pokémon Yellow (underneath the duvet with a torch in case my mum walked in and saw I wasn't sleeping). From my little Game Boy Color to now playing it on my Nintendo Switch, Pokémon has certainly come a long way. However, I still find it as comforting, endearing, exciting, and fun as ever.

So, of course, when I was looking for a data science project, there was really only ever going to be one option.

The purpose of this project is to explore some Pokémon data and try to gain some interesting insights, such as the number of Pokémon by type, examining height and weight and exploring how these correlate with type, and analysing how final evolution status affects stats. Additionally, I will try to predict if a Pokémon is legendary using machine learning.

As Ash would say, "I choose you, data science!". It is time to leave Pallet Town and explore...

## Data

The data used in this project comes from a Kaggle dataset called "The All Pokémon Dataset." This dataset includes 898 Pokémon, starting with the first-generation Bulbasaur and ending with the legendary eighth-generation Psychic/Ghost type, Calyrex Shadow Rider. Each row in the dataset represents a different Pokémon and contains a total of 44 variables. The primary outcome I will be trying to predict is the "Legendary" status. Many of the columns in this dataset correspond to the individual Pokémon’s weaknesses and resistances against different types.
